## Developing Methods
- **SCRUM Framework**:
  - Weekly sprints with clear sprint goals
  - Daily stand-ups for progress tracking
  - Sprint planning and retrospectives
  - Backlog refinement sessions
  - Continuous integration and delivery

- **Project Management**:
  - Kanban board in Trello for task tracking
  - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - Task prioritization and estimation
  - Visual progress tracking
  - Team collaboration and transparency

- **Development Workflow**:
  - Feature branch development
  - Code reviews
  - Pair programming sessions
  - Regular team sync-ups
  - Continuous feedback loops

## Main Features
- **Match Management**: Registration and updating of matches with detailed statistics
- **Player Management**: Registration and updating of players
- **Player Statistics**: Comprehensive statistics and history for each player
- **User Management**: Secure login and role-based access control

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Razor Pages and Javascript
- **Backend**: .NET 9, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity

## Patterns and Principals

### Architecture Patterns
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access)
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer for database operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling and testability through IoC container

### Design Patterns
- **Razor Pages Pattern**: Page-based UI framework with built-in separation of concerns
- **DTO Pattern**: Data Transfer Objects for API communication
- **Adapter Pattern**: Using Mapster for object mapping
- **Service Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation in service classes
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation and configuration

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
  - Example: `SetService` handles only set-related operations
  - Example: `PlayerService` manages player-specific functionality
  - Example: `MatchService` focuses solely on match management

- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Example: `PagedResultBase` abstract class allows extension through inheritance
  - Example: Service interfaces (`ISetService`, `IMatchService`, `IPlayerService`) enable new implementations without modifying existing code

- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes can substitute base classes
  - Example: `PagedResult<T>` extends `PagedResultBase` and can be used interchangeably
  - Example: Service implementations can be swapped without affecting the application

- **Interface Segregation**: Client-specific interfaces
  - Example: `ISetService` defines only set-related operations
  - Example: `IPlayerService` contains only player-specific methods
  - Example: `IMatchService` focuses on match-related functionality

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
  - Example: Services depend on interfaces (`ISetService`, `IMatchService`) rather than concrete implementations
  - Example: Dependency injection in `Program.cs` for service registration
  - Example: Constructor injection in services (`MatchService`, `PlayerService`, `SetService`)

### Best Practices
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming for better performance
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and logging
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests for critical functionality
